# Convolutional Neural Network - Self Driving Car

## Introduction
With [Udacity's car simulator](https://github.com/udacity/self-driving-car-sim/), machine learning enthusiasts can easily use the embedded image feed from the virtual car to create a self-driving car. My implementation of this idea incorporates [research publications from Nvidia](https://devblogs.nvidia.com/deep-learning-self-driving-cars/) to construct the neural network, Keras as the machine learning framework (with Tensorflow backend), and Python in order to drive a car around a map.

## Results

Here are short gifs that demonstrate the model's ability to maneuver the car around a race track. While there are no automated benchmarks for performance, I ran the network for over 5 hours and the car had never crashed.
